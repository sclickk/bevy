# Eric's Bevy Fork

This is my local fork of the Bevy engine. I kept it for a while writing small programs with it while getting a bunch of ideas that I could never get out of my head. I have no use for this code anymore since I'm going to be homeless and lose access to my PC very soon, and would like to share it with the contributors and anyone(?) on the Bevy team that may be intrested in using my code. This source code includes updates up unto [this commit](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/a9cb18eefc621c04bf09aec348fc72e309ad1726). Since I have absolutely no time to work on this code any further, or pull from upstream, I will not be taking any PRs/patches for this.

Very little actually changed in this code. I managed to make it much more modular and I made a lot of changes to ECS systems (notably by using `Query`'s iteration methods). This is one of my first forks I worked on in quite some time and I really enjoyed working with it as my first real exposure to Rust. I previously dabbled in web development in my teens with PHP and JS/TS, again never making it very far thanks to being so brain-dead. I once again have failed to make anything meaningful or useful with this source code release.

I would like to thank to Bevy contributors for their work on this. It seems very polished and usable and I hope further development makes it more advanced than I ever could on my own.
