* Use Query's `for_each` and `for_each_mut` methods in more areas.
* Use `into_iter` instead of `iter` where it can be used,
* Impl `IntoIterator` and `Index` for more items.
* use `contains` instead of `enumerate find` where possible
* use `filter_map` instead of `filter` and `map` where applicable.
* Code duplication everywhere!
    `last_change_tick` and `change_tick` are used everywehre in the engine for
    all sorts of types. Maybe use something like `TickTracker`?

* use `map_or`
* lots of unidiomatic `unwrap` usages.
* some examples are too slow/could be optimized better (80fps on `breakout` with ryzen apu!?!?)
* fix up mikktspace/upstream crate https://github.com/gltf-rs/mikktspace
